Via Upsampling and Downsampling I built this model throgh several classifier algorithms . Found best accuracy by naive bayes classifier . The data file is huge .Sorry I couldnt upload that . The dataset are available at kaggle and that are well featured as you dont have to worry about data preprocessing stuffs . :)
